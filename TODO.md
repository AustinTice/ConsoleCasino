### TODO's
- We need to develop an opening Prompt that displays some ASCII art and the possible games that users can play
- We will start with a few basic games: Slots, Blackjack, and Roulette. These will all be implemented precisely with a main
"profile" that could possibly just be stored as a class so that the user has an actual "Casino Experience".
- Need to develop an appropriate way to store and reuse the player data within the console. I'll have to look into this.
