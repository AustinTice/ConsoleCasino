### TODO's
- We need to develop an opening Prompt that displays some ASCII art and the possible games that users can play
- We will start with a few basic games: Slots, Blackjack, and Roulette. These will all be implemented precisely with a main
"profile" that could possibly just be stored as a class so that the user has an actual "Casino Experience".
- Need to develop an appropriate way to store and reuse the player data within the console(Maybe some sort of database or log file). I'll have to look into this.

**Blackjack**
<hr>
- Needs work to be built from the ground up

**Roulette**
<hr>
- Needs work to be built from the ground up

**Slot Machine**
<hr>
- Needs to be optimized for the best user experience.
- Need to provide a banking functionality that can allow a more realistic experience.
- Allow users to buy in - add max and min bets etc. 
- Possibly a GUI would be nice if we could implement that for a slot machine.
